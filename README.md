### Summary
Microlending platform for raising funds, matching loan applicants with lenders and tracking analytics. This application was designed as a proof of concept for Miray Lending, a non-profit based in Madagascar. However, the intention of this codebase is to be left fairly flavorless in order to be repurposed for the growing microlending industry.

### Case Study

This service is aimed at donors looking for a level of interaction in their donations. By helping donors see the impact of their giving, the goal is that donors will give more often and give effectively. Although, eventually this platform will support entrepreneurs in the application process for loans, this has been put off to a future update.

### Backend Info

The backend of this project was built on Node/Express and uses PostsgreSQL and Waterline ORM. The backend supports active borrower users as well as donor users, but the current frontend iteration of this project only allows admin users to create borrower users.

### Frontend Info

The frontend is built with Angular and uses custom directives to implement features like entrepreneur/loan cards that are accessible across multiple views.
